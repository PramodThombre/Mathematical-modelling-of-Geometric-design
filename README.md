# Mathematical-modelling-of-Geometric-design

A teddy bear was designed using mathematical modelling using Bezier, BSpline and NURBs curves and surface patches.
 Parts such as hands, legs, eyes, nose, head, body were created individually and then assembled in Microsoft 3D builder.
A .stl file was created and it was used to 3D print the teddy bear.
